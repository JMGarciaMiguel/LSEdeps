The compound relation is used to analyze compounds, that is, combinations of lexemes that morphosyntactically behave as single words. Compound subtypes in LSE are:
•	Serial verbs, for which the subtype [compound:svc]() is used.
•	Verb sandwich constructions, that consists of the repetition or near-repetition of the verb, for which the subtype [compound:vsc]() was created.
•	Other repetition of signs, analyzed as [compound:redup]().
