An open clausal complement (`xcomp`) of a verb or an adjective is a predicative or clausal complement without its own subject. The reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument external to the xcomp (normally by the subject or object of the next higher clause, if there is one). These are complements (arguments of the higher verb or adjective) rather than adjuncts/modifiers, such as a purpose clause. The name `xcomp` is borrowed from Lexical-Functional Grammar.
